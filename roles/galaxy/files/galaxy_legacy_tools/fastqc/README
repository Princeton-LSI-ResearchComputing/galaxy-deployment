FastQC aims to provide a simple way to do some quality control checks on raw sequence data coming from high throughput sequencing pipelines. It provides a modular set of analyses which you can use to give a quick impression of whether your data has any problems of which you should be aware before doing any further analysis.

The main functions of FastQC are:

- Import of data from BAM, SAM or FastQ files (any variant)
- Providing a quick overview to tell you in which areas there may be problems
- Summary graphs and tables to quickly assess your data
- Export of results to an HTML based permanent report
- Offline operation to allow automated generation of reports without running the interactive application

Galaxy Tool Wrapper
-------------------

The galaxy tool wrapper for FastQC requires version:   FastQC v0.7.2 

FastQC should be downloaded and installed on the system on which it will be executed.  
The PATH environment variable should include the directory in which the fastqc script resides.

The fastqc.py wrapper invokes the fastqc script provided in FastQC download, 
and converts the FastQC results into a Galaxy html formatted dataset.
