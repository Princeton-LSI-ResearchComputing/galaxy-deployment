                </h3>
                <p>There are many approaches to learning how to use Galaxy. The most popular is
                    probably to just dive in and use it. Galaxy is simple enough to use that you can
                    do many analyses just by exploring the interface. However, you may miss much of
                    the power this way.</p>

                <h3><a target="_parent" href="/tours">Interactive Tours</a></h3>
                <p>Select from basic and advanced tours to get an interactive walkthrough of many
                    of Galaxy's features (and remember, you can click 'End Tour' at any
                    time).</p>

                            workflow completion and can discuss the contents of a workflow, point out interesting aspects of individual
                            outputs, and generally help you summarize the outputs for colleagues in a comprehensible way!
