				<h2>Getting Started with Galaxy</h2>

				<h3>
					<a target="_blank" href="https://galaxyproject.org/learn/">Learn Galaxy</a>
				</h3>
				<p>There are many approaches to learning how to use Galaxy. The most popular is
					probably to just dive in and use it. Galaxy is simple enough to use that you can
					do many analyses just by exploring the interface. However, you may miss much of
					the power this way.</p>

				<h3><a target="_parent" href="/tours">Interactive Tours</a></h3>
				<p>Select from basic and advanced tours to get an interactive walkthrough of many
					of Galaxy's features (and remember, you can click 'End Tour' at any
					time).</p>

				<h3>
					<a target="_blank" href="https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/">Galaxy Training</a>
				</h3>
				<p>Collection of tutorials developed and maintained by the worldwide Galaxy community.</p>

				<h3>Princeton Community</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Join the
						<a target="_blank" href="https://sites.google.com/site/princetonhtseq/">Princeton HTSEQ Users Group</a>,
						discuss, present, and learn from other users in the Princeton research community</li>
					<li>Get expert advice from the

				<h2>What's New</h2>
				<h3>
					<a href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DEXSeq.html">DEXSeq</a>
				</h3>
				<p>
					Find differential exon usage using RNA-seq exon counts between samples with different experimental
					designs. Also provides functions for the visualization and exploration of the results.

				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Extensive Workflow Enhancements</strong>
						<p>Workflows got a lot of love this time around, with new runtime parameters for subworkflows,
							exposed workflow versions, and zoom capability in the editor, to name a few. There were
							also a number of usability enhancements including better labeling, links, overhauled workflow
							import interfaces, and many more.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Group Tags</strong>
						<p>Galaxy now contains powerful new features for multiple factor analysis of collections of
							datasets. The concept of group tags has been added to Galaxy. These are a special class
							of tags that describe key-value pairs that can be attached to the contents of a collection
							during upload or using collection operation tools. These tags can describe multiple sets
							of variables for the contents of a collection. Once set, these tags can be consumed
							intelligently by tools that need to divide collections into multiple overlapping factors or
							sets of datasets. A special thanks to <a href="https://github.com/mvdbeek">@mvdbeek</a> for
							devising and implementing this approach.

				<h2>Disk Space is Limited</h2>
				<h3>Please delete datasets you no longer need to make room for others</h3>
				<p>By viewing your list of saved histories, you can see how much space each is
					taking up. Please delete any histories that you no longer need. Your cooperation
					is appreciated.
				</p>
				<h3>Data stored for more than 30 days may be deleted without notice.</h3>
