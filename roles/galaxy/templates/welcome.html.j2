				<h2>Getting Started with Galaxy</h2>

				<h3>
					<a target="_blank" href="https://galaxyproject.org/learn/">Learn Galaxy</a>
				</h3>
				<p>There are many approaches to learning how to use Galaxy. The most popular is
					probably to just dive in and use it. Galaxy is simple enough to use that you can
					do many analyses just by exploring the interface. However, you may miss much of
					the power this way.</p>

				<h3><a target="_parent" href="/tours">Interactive Tours</a></h3>
				<p>Select from basic and advanced tours to get an interactive walkthrough of many
					of Galaxy's features (and remember, you can click 'End Tour' at any
					time).</p>

				<h3>
					<a target="_blank" href="https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/">Galaxy Training</a>
				</h3>
				<p>Collection of tutorials developed and maintained by the worldwide Galaxy community.</p>

				<h3>Princeton Community</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Join the
						<a target="_blank" href="https://sites.google.com/site/princetonhtseq/">Princeton HTSEQ Users Group</a>,
						discuss, present, and learn from other users in the Princeton research community</li>
					<li>Get expert advice from the
						<a target="_blank" href="http://www.princeton.edu/genomics/sequencing/">Lewis-Sigler Sequencing Core Facility</a>

				<h2>What's New</h2>
				<h3>
					<a
						target="_blank"
						href="https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/release_19.05/releases/19.05_announce_user.html">Galaxy Release 19.05</a>
				</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Tool Favorites</strong>
						<p>Tools can now be marked as favorites, and then they’ll be easily accessible from the star button in your tool panel.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Workflow Editor Connection Feedback</strong>
						<p>The editor now provides feedback on why connections are invalid, so you aren’t left wondering
						   why two tools won’t connect. For complex data pipelines this should greatly simplify your life!
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Data Dialog for Tool Form</strong>
						<p>There is a new way to select datasets when running tools! It is a very simple method to select 
						   any number of files from both your History and Data Libraries.</p>
						<p>Additionally the selector implements a highly requested feature, the ability to run tools on arbitrary datasets 
						   from a collection</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>History Export/Import Reworked</strong>
						<p>These features used to be clumsy in the past but do not despair since in this release they got a revamp and their
							reliability skyrocketed! Moving historic object across Galaxies should now be easier than ever. Rocketfuel included.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>
					<a
						target="_blank"
						href="https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/release_19.09/releases/19.09_announce_user.html">Galaxy Release 19.09</a>
				</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Workflow Reporting</strong>
						<p>John Chilton added embedded reports to workflows. These are reports which are automatically available upon 
							workflow completion and can discuss the contents of a workflow, point out interesting aspects of individual
							outputs, and generally help you summarize the outputs for colleagues in a comprehensible way!
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Cleaner History Menu</strong>
						<p>Check out the new, cleaner history menu! Many of the extraneous actions were moved out so you can more
							quickly do what you need to do.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Awesome Visualizations</strong>
						<p>The Community (that is you!) added not one, not two, but three new awesome visualizations in this release
							allowing for free style image annotation, visualizing spatial data on OpenLayers maps, and exploring HIV
							NGS data with hyphy-vision.
						</p>
					</li>
